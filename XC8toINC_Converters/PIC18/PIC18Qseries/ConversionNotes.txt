This uses MPLAB-X 6.xx
However, the source files for the CONFIG have incorrect masks, and, therefore the INC file produced has the incorrect bit values.

Example

C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLABX\v5.50\packs\Microchip\PIC18F-Q_DFP\1.11.185\xc8\pic\dat\cfgdata\18f27q84.cfgdata

is CWORD:300002:FF:3F:CONFIG3 should be CWORD:300002:FF:FF:CONFIG3
is CWORD:300004:7F:9F:CONFIG5 should be CWORD:300004:7F:FF:CONFIG5

So, edit the .cfgdata before conversation to resolve the issue.
