'This constant is exposed as ChipPSP
PSP=0

'This constant is exposed as ChipUSART

'This constant is exposed as ChipMaxAddress
MaxAddress=511

';Microcontroller specific configuration Constants used in specific libraries, compiler or user programs
';This section of constants is specific to a microcontroller, so the constants may not be present for all microcontrollers

'WriteFlashBlocksize constant is used in user programs that write to flash memory in bytes
WriteFlashBlockSize=0

'EraseFlashBlockSize constant is used in user programs that write to flash memory in bytes
EraseFlashBlockSize=0

'ChipSelfWrite constant is used within the compiler to indicate the chip is self write capable
SelfWrite=0

[Interrupts]
'For specific details of the interrupts see the microcontroller datasheet
'The first parameter is the GCBASIC identifier used in user code to expose the specific interrupt

[Registers]
'For specific details of the registers see the microcontroller datasheet
'The first parameter is the GCBASIC register name used in user code to expose the specific register

[Bits]
'For details of the bits (relative to a register in terms of registerbits) see the microcontroller datasheet
'The first parameter is the GCBASIC bit name used in user code to expose the specific registerbit

[FreeRAM]

[NoBankRAM]
'NoBankRAM is somewhat misnamed - it is used for the defintion of (any) access bank locations
'If a memory location is defined in both NoBankRAM and FreeRAM, then the compiler knows that it is access bank RAM.
'If an SFR location is in one of the NoBankRAM ranges, then the compiler knows not to do any bank selection when accessing that register.

'The NoBankRAM section must include two ranges, one for access bank RAM, one for access bank SFRs, or there will be issues.
'The first range MUST be the ACCESS RAM range
'The first range is the FAST SFR range

'If there are no ranges defined in NoBankRAM, the compiler will try to guess them.
'On 18Fs, it will guess based on where the lowest SFR is, and from what the total RAM on the chip is. If there's only one range defined
'in the NoBankRAM locations, the compiler will assume that is the range for the RAM, and then will guess where the range for the access bank SFRs is.

[ASMConfig]
'The GCBASIC compiler default configuration for a specific microcontroller

[ConfigMask]

[ConfigOps]
'For details of the config options see the microcontroller datasheet
'The first parameter is the configuration field that can be used to expose specific configuration bits
'The other parameters are the configuration field options that can be set

[Config]
'For details of the config addresses see the microcontroller datasheet
