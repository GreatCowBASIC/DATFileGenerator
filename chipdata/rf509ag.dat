';Microcontroller specific configuration. Constants used within specific libraries, the compiler or user programs. All sourced from chip data database.
';This section of constants is specific to a microcontroller.  Therefore, the constants may not be present for a specific microcontroller.

'CHIPSTACKS csn be used within  user programs.  This constant provides information with respect to the number of stacks avaiable 
Stacks=2

'CHIPUSERIDADDRESS is used within user programs.  This constant provides information with respect to the address of the UserID.
UserIDAddress=1024

'CHIPUSERIDLENGTH is used within user programs.  This constant provides information with respect to the length of the UserID (in words). 
UserIDLength=4
