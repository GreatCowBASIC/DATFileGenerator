[NoBankRAM]
'NoBankRAM is somewhat misnamed - it is used for the defintion of (any) access bank locations
'If a memory location is defined in both NoBankRAM and FreeRAM, then the compiler knows that it is access bank RAM.
'If an SFR location is in one of the NoBankRAM ranges, then the compiler knows not to do any bank selection when accessing that register.

'The NoBankRAM section must include two ranges, one for access bank RAM, one for access bank SFRs, or there will be issues.
'The first range MUST be the ACCESS RAM range
'The first range is the FAST SFR range

'If there are no ranges defined in NoBankRAM, the compiler will try to guess them.
'On 18Fs, it will guess based on where the lowest SFR is, and from what the total RAM on the chip is. If there's only one range defined
'in the NoBankRAM locations, the compiler will assume that is the range for the RAM, and then will guess where the range for the access bank SFRs is.
