<!-- This DTD matches up with the <pinDefinitions> vocabulary that we got -->
<!-- from Sunrise.  As with other vocabularies, I deleted the @comment -->
<!-- attribute from an element here and there so I could tighten this DTD. -->

<!-- The semantics of the <connection@port> and <connection@pin> attributes -->
<!-- are not so good in this vocabulary.  We should definitely fix them on -->
<!-- the next revision of this vocabulary. -->
